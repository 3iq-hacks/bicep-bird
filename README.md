# Bicep Bird

## Frontend

Fish game (currently)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This is a game designed to test the mettle of any mortal that dares defy the will of Poseidon. Those that fare well shall earn their plaice; otherwise, an eel fate awaits in their sole.

Are you shark enough to skate to victory? There's only one way to sea and find trout. May cod be with you.
